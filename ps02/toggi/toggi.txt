Toggi loves the number pi. Toggi quite likes making his computer calulate pi
but that can take quite a long time, depends a bit on the number of digits
he wants to calculate. If he calculates the first n digits of pi it takes 
n log10(n)/10⁶ seconds, where log10 denotes a logarithm of base 10.
He wants to know to how many digits of pi he can calculate in the time he has.
Help him find out.

Input
You are given an integer C, the number of seconds Toggi has.

Output
One line containing the integer n, the maximum number of digits of pi
that Toggi can calculate in C seconds.

Explanation of Sample Inputs
Toggi can calculate 189481 digits in one second because
189481 log10(189481)/10^6 ≈ 0.9999984203540794 <= 1
But he can’t calculate more digits in a single seond beause
189482 log10(189482)/10^6 ≈ 1.0000041322153754 > 1
