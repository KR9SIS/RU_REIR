         * Problem Statement
         * A reporter wants to find out what point difference occurs the most frequently
         * in games in the football league. Namely, if one team scores 68 and the other
         * 75, the point difference is 7. He has the outcome of all n games in the
         * league (stored in an array) and needs your help determining the most common
         * point difference. Describe an Î˜(n log n) algorithm to do so.
         * For instance, if the games went: 75 vs. 67, 95 vs. 80, 92 vs. 100, then 8 is
         * the most common point difference.
